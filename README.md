# Credit Scoring - A basic introduction

## Deep Learning approach

### Presentation of the Notebook:

In this notebook, an interpretable Neural Network to handle famous credit scoring classification problem is introduced.

The notebook is structured into three sections:

-   In Section 1, we undertake data preprocessing, which involves scaling the numerical features and applying Label Encoding to the categorical features.
-   In Section 2, we develop and train a model, as depicted in the following diagram:

-   In Section 3, we adapt the model presented in Section 2 to address a sequential problem.
